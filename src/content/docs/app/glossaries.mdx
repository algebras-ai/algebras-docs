## Overview

Glossaries ensure consistent translation of specific terms, names, and phrases across your content. They're essential for brand consistency, technical terminology, and product names.

## Creating a Glossary

1. Navigate to **Glossaries** from the sidebar (under Translation).
2. Click **New Glossary** or the **+** button.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your glossary.
4. Select the languages this glossary will support (source and target languages).
5. Choose how to populate your glossary:
   - **Empty**: Start with a blank glossary.
   - **Prefill with AI Extraction**: Automatically extract terms from sample text.

## Adding Terms Manually

1. Open your glossary.
2. Click **Add Terms**.
3. Select the language pair you're adding terms for.
4. Enter the source term and its translation.
5. Optionally add a definition or context note.
6. Click **Add Term**.
7. Repeat for additional terms.

## AI Extraction

Extract terms automatically from your existing content:

1. Open your glossary (or create a new one with "Prefill with AI Extraction").
2. Click **Add Terms**.
3. Select the **Extract** tab.
4. Paste sample text (up to 150,000 characters) that contains terms you want to extract.
5. Click **Extract**.
6. Review the AI-suggested terms:
   - Accept terms that are correct.
   - Edit terms that need adjustment.
   - Skip terms that aren't relevant.
7. Selected terms are automatically added to your glossary.

**Best practices for extraction**:
- Use representative content that includes your key terminology.
- Longer text samples typically yield better results.
- Review and refine extracted terms before accepting.

## Editing and Managing Terms

- **Edit a term**: Click on any term in the glossary to modify it.
- **Delete a term**: Remove individual terms as needed.
- **Bulk import**: Import terms via CSV for large glossaries.
- **Export**: Download your glossary as CSV for backup or migration.

## Using Glossaries in Translation

### In the Playground

1. Open the Playground.
2. Select your source and target languages.
3. Choose your glossary from the glossary dropdown (only matching language pairs are shown).
4. Run your translation - glossary terms are automatically enforced.
5. If a term isn't applied correctly, update your glossary and re-run.

### In API Calls

Include the glossary ID in your API request to apply terms programmatically.

## Glossary Status

Glossaries have status indicators:
- **OK**: Ready to use
- **CREATING**: Being set up
- **UPDATING**: Changes in progress
- **DELETING**: Removal in progress
- **ERROR**: An issue occurred

Wait for status to be OK before using in translations.

## Tips

1. **Keep terms specific**: Generic terms may match unintentionally.
2. **Use base forms**: Add "car" rather than "cars" - the system handles inflections.
3. **Regular maintenance**: Review and update glossaries as your terminology evolves.
4. **Test your glossary**: Use the Playground to verify terms are applied correctly.
5. **Organize by domain**: Create separate glossaries for different products or domains.
6. **Version control**: Consider duplicating glossaries before major changes for rollback capability.
