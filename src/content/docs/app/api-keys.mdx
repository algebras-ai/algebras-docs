## Create a key
1. Open API Keys.
2. Click Create key and add a label.
3. Copy the key once; it may not be shown again.

## Manage
- Revoke compromised or unused keys.
- Rotate keys periodically (create new, update apps, then revoke old).
- Restrict usage if scopes/IP allowlists are available.

## Use
- Send the key as an Authorization header (e.g., `Bearer <key>`).
- Store in secrets managers, not in code or repos.

## Security tips
- Limit access to least privilege.
- Never share in tickets or chats.
- Monitor usage; revoke on anomalies.
