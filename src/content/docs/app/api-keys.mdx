## Overview

API keys allow you to programmatically access translation services via REST API. Keys are scoped to organizations, so each organization can have its own set of API keys.

## Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to **API Keys** from the sidebar (under Organization).
2. Click **Create new API Key**.
3. Enter a descriptive label for the key (e.g., "Production Server", "CLI Tool", "Test Environment").
4. Click **Create**.
5. **Important**: Copy the API key immediately - it's only shown once for security.
6. Store the key securely before closing the dialog.

**Security Note**: API keys are only displayed once during creation. If you lose a key, you must create a new one.

## Using API Keys

### Authentication

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.algebras.ai/v1/translation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_language": "en",
    "target_languages": ["es", "fr"],
    "text": "Hello, world!"
  }'
```

## Managing API Keys

### Viewing Keys

The API Keys page shows:
- Key label (descriptive name)
- Created date
- Created by (user who created the key)
- Partial key view (masked for security)

### Revoking Keys

1. Go to **API Keys**.
2. Find the key you want to revoke.
3. Click the revoke/delete action.
4. Confirm revocation.
5. **Immediate effect**: The key stops working immediately - update your applications.

### Rotating Keys

For security, rotate keys periodically:

1. Create a new API key with the same or updated label.
2. Update your application(s) to use the new key.
3. Test that everything works with the new key.
4. Revoke the old key.

This process ensures zero downtime during key rotation.

## Key Management Best Practices

### Organization and Labeling

- Use descriptive labels that indicate the key's purpose.
- Include environment in the label (prod, staging, dev).
- Note which service or application uses each key.

### Security

1. **Never commit keys to version control**: Use environment variables or secrets managers.
2. **Use secrets managers**: Store keys in tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or similar.
3. **Limit key distribution**: Only share keys with authorized team members.
4. **Monitor usage**: Watch for unexpected API usage that might indicate a compromised key.
5. **Rotate regularly**: Change keys every 90 days or when team members leave.
6. **One key per service**: Create separate keys for different applications to enable individual revocation.

### Access Control

- API keys inherit the permissions of the organization they belong to.
- Keys created in an organization can only access that organization's resources.
- Members with appropriate roles can create keys for their organization.

## Troubleshooting

### Key Not Working

1. Verify the key is copied correctly (no extra spaces or characters).
2. Check that the key hasn't been revoked.
3. Ensure you're using `Bearer` authentication in the Authorization header.
4. Verify the key belongs to the correct organization.

### Rate Limiting

- API keys are subject to rate limits based on your plan.
- Check your plan's API rate limits in the documentation.
- Contact support if you need higher limits.

## Integration Examples

### CLI Tool

Configure your CLI tool with the API key from your account settings. The key is automatically available in the API Keys section.

### Server Applications

Store API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export ALGEBRAS_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### CI/CD Pipelines

Use your CI/CD platform's secrets management to inject API keys during builds and deployments.
