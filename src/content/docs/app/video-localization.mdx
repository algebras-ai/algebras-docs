## Overview

Video Localization allows you to translate video content by generating subtitles and/or dubbing audio in multiple languages. The system transcribes source audio, translates the content, and produces synchronized subtitles and natural-sounding voice-overs.

## Supported Languages

Video localization supports 28 languages:

**European Languages**: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Dutch, Czech, Romanian, Slovak, Croatian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Greek, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Ukrainian

**Asian Languages**: Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Tamil, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Filipino

**Other**: Arabic, Turkish, Finnish

Note: Video translation uses different language codes than text translation. The UI will show only supported video languages when working with videos.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to **Translate Video** from the sidebar (under Translation).
2. Upload your source video file.
3. The system automatically detects the source language from the audio.

5. Choose your output options (see below).

## Advanced Settings

### Using Glossaries

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Clear audio**: Ensure source video has clear, audible speech for better transcription accuracy.
2. **Use glossaries**: For brand names, product names, or technical terms, create and use glossaries.
3. **Language selection**: Verify your target languages are supported before starting.
4. **Processing time**: Larger videos and multiple languages take longer - be patient.
5. **Review translations**: Always review subtitles and audio for accuracy before publishing.
