## Overview

The Playground is your primary interface for translating text. It supports 100+ languages with auto-detection, custom prompts, glossaries, and advanced modifiers to fine-tune translations.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to **Playground** from the sidebar (under Translation).
2. Paste or type your text in the source input area.
3. Select source language (or choose "Detect language" for auto-detection).
4. Select one or multiple target languages.
5. Click **Translate** to generate results.
6. Review the translation in the output area.

## Language Selection

- **Source languages**: Choose from 100+ languages or use "Detect language" (auto) to automatically identify the input language.
- **Target languages**: Select one or multiple target languages for batch translation.
- Languages are searchable by name or code.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Prompts

Access prompts via the settings icon (⚙️) in the bottom-right corner of the Playground interface.

1. Click the settings icon to open the modifiers menu.
2. Select **Prompts**.
3. Enter your custom instruction text. Examples:
   - "Maintain a formal, legal tone"
   - "Use simple language suitable for children"
   - "Keep technical terminology in English"
   - "Translate for marketing purposes with a friendly tone"
4. Your prompt guides the AI's translation style and approach.
5. You can save and reuse prompts from your prompts history.

### Translation Modifiers

Access modifiers via the settings icon:

- **Agentic Mode**: Enables advanced AI reasoning for complex translations.
- **Translation Flag**: Control specific translation behaviors (available in standard mode).
- **Ignore Cache**: Bypass cached results to get fresh translations.

### Using Glossaries

1. In the Playground, select a glossary from the glossary dropdown.
2. The selected glossary enforces your defined terms throughout the translation.
3. Glossary terms take priority over default translations.
4. Only glossaries matching your language pair are shown.

## Viewing Results

- Translations appear in separate panels for each target language.
- Results include word count information.
- You can copy individual results or export multiple translations.
- Compare results side-by-side for multiple target languages.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic translation, then add modifiers and prompts as needed.
2. **Be specific with prompts**: Clear, concise instructions work better than vague requests.
3. **Use glossaries for consistency**: Especially important for product names, technical terms, and brand-specific language.
4. **Save successful prompts**: Keep notes of prompts that work well for your use cases.
5. **Review and iterate**: Use the retry feature to refine translations with adjusted settings.
