description: Translate text with advanced features, prompts, and settings.

## What you can do
- **Languages**: choose source/target (auto-detect supported).
- **Quality controls**: tone, style, formality, length.
- **Custom prompts**: guide phrasing/terminology.
- **Glossaries**: enforce terms.
- **Batch input**: multiple segments.
- **Review tools**: retry, refine with edits.

## Get a translation fast
1. Open Playground and paste text.
2. Set source/target languages (or use auto-detect).
3. Optional: set tone, formality, and length.
4. Optional: attach a glossary.
5. Optional: add a custom prompt (see below).
6. Run translation.
7. Review result; retry or refine as needed.

## Using prompts effectively
- **Instruction style**: state goals plainly (e.g., “Keep legal tone. Avoid slang.”).
- **Context**: add audience, domain, and constraints.
- **Terminology**: combine with a glossary for consistency.
- **Refinement**: re-run with adjusted prompt for targeted changes.

## Tips
- Start simple; add controls only when needed.
- Save common prompts externally for reuse.
- Use glossary for product names and regulated phrasing.
