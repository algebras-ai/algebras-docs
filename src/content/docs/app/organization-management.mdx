## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate roles**: Follow the principle of least privilege - only grant necessary permissions.
2. **Separate personal and team work**: Create separate organizations for personal projects vs. team collaboration.
3. **Regular audits**: Periodically review member list and roles to ensure access is current.
4. **Clear naming**: Use descriptive organization names to distinguish between different teams or projects.
5. **Ownership planning**: Ensure multiple Owners for critical organizations to avoid lockout scenarios.
